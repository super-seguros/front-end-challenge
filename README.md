# Frontend challenge

This repository hosts SÃºper Seguros frontend challenge solution.

## Tech stack

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Tailwind Elements](https://tailwind-elements.com/)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as development server and production bundler
- [Serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve) as production build static server

## Running this project

```shell
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Run development server
npm start

# Create production build and run static server
npm run prod
```

## Notes

React, Vue, Svelte or any other framework, UI library or template engine could be used to solve this challenge.
Using any of those seemed like an overkill so decision was made to go with pure HTML.
Final solution is less than 300 lines of HTML code.
